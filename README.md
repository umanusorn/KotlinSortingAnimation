# KotlinSortingAnimation

This project aims to practice Kotlin. The project will do sorting on Android with animation and sound like this youtube

My idea is to compare the sorting and how each sort behave.

**I plan to.**
 0. Add automate testing, crashlytic etc.
 1. User can generate dummy data with a different characteristic.
 2. User can choose sorting algor.
 3. There will be bubble, selection, insertion sort and the other sort will added later.
 4. Show up to 2 sorting run simultaneously to compare
 5. Summarize each sorting after run
 6. Publish to PlayStore

 **Future**
 1. Add sound when sorting
 2. Record screen when sorting and share to social
 3. Add explanation for each sort (kind of education)
 4. Link to some learning resource about sorting
 5. Embedded ads and donation
 6. Create a blog for this project
 7. Show up to 4 sorting run simultaneously in order to compare
 8. Add voice command
 9. Add voice when press random, sort etc.
 10. Add About us include collaborators
 11. Licenses for any open sources licenses
 11. Let user send feedback (I want to try Firebase)
 12. Dialog ask to give star
 13. Use Firebase real-time db to compare phone performance with friends. Every player need to do sorting assignment. Everyone can see result of the other. The result will show which phone use lesser time to sort (I just want to try Firebase lol)

 Welcome for the suggestion on my code.
